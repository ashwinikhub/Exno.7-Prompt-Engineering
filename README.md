Aim:
To develop a prompt-based application tailored to personal needs—such as organizing daily tasks—while fostering creativity and practical problem-solving through large language models like ChatGPT. The goal is to understand how prompt design impacts the effectiveness and clarity of generated outputs.

Objective:
To create and refine prompt structures that enable ChatGPT to assist in:

Daily task organization
Prioritization of work
Scheduling based on time availability
Enhancing productivity and clarity
Procedure:
Understanding the Basics of Prompt Engineering:
Learn how LLMs (Large Language Models) interpret and respond to different prompt styles.
Start with basic instructions and analyze how prompt complexity influences output quality.
Use ChatGPT as the AI model for generating, updating, and organizing task lists.
1. Basic Prompt for Task Listing:
Begin with a simple prompt to generate a generic to-do list.

Example Prompt: "List 5 important tasks I need to complete today."

Expected Output: A basic unordered list of tasks without prioritization or time context.

2. Prompt for Task Prioritization:
Enhance the prompt to include task importance and urgency.

Example Prompt: "List 5 tasks I need to complete today and rank them in order of priority."

Expected Output: An ordered task list labeled with priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

3. Time-Sensitive Prompting:
Add constraints based on available hours or deadlines.

Example Prompt: "I have 4 hours free today. Suggest a schedule to complete these tasks: cleaning, homework, gym, and grocery shopping."

Expected Output: A time-blocked plan allocating specific durations to each task based on priority and time limits.

4. Interactive Prompting for Updates:
Simulate user feedback to modify tasks.

Example Prompt: "Remove gym from the plan and add 'project research'. Update the schedule accordingly."

Expected Output: An adjusted plan with real-time changes and updated time blocks.

5. Prompt Templates for Reusability:
Create generalized prompts that can be reused daily.

Example Template: "I have {X} hours available today. My tasks include: {Task List}. Create a prioritized and time-blocked schedule."

Use Case: Ideal for building into a daily task assistant or productivity bot.

Deliverables:
Set of Prompts: From basic task lists to structured schedules
Generated Task Plans: Sample outputs from different prompt types
Prompt Templates: Customizable templates for regular use
Insights: Observations on how prompt detail affects usefulness and output clarity
Sample Comparison:
Naive Prompt:
"Give me a task list."

Output:

Check emails
Clean room
Finish assignment
Go for a walk
Call mom
Result: Lacks structure, urgency, or time-awareness.

Refined Prompt:
"I have 6 hours available. Prioritize and schedule these tasks: assignment, cooking, laundry, and a 1-hour workout."

Output:

9:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Complete assignment (High priority)
10:30 AM - 11:30 AM: Workout
11:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Cooking
12:30 PM - 1:30 PM: Laundry
Result: Structured and time-sensitive plan optimized for daily productivity.

Conclusion:
This experiment illustrates how prompt engineering can transform a language model into a personalized productivity assistant. Starting from basic instructions and advancing to complex, context-rich prompts significantly enhances the quality and relevance of AI-generated outputs. These techniques can be further extended to:

Academic planning
Professional scheduling
Habit tracking
Multi-user assistant bots
Final Result:
The prompt-based application was successfully developed and demonstrated, validating how structured prompting can lead to more useful and intelligent task management using AI tools like ChatGPT.
